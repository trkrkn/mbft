Suspension of Convertibility\n\nIdea: Temporarily freeze withdrawals, forcing all depositors to wait.\n\nMechanism: Breaks the run dynamic since \\(f\\) is fixed regardless of beliefs \\(\\hat f\\).\n\nUpside: Stops panic instantly.\n\nDownside: Very costly → disrupts payments, destroys trust, can trigger broader panic.\n\nHistorical use: 19th century U.S. banks and Argentina’s “corralito” in 2001.\n\n\n\n3. Lender of Last Resort (LOLR)\n\nIdea: Central bank provides emergency liquidity when banks face sudden outflows.\n\nMechanism: By lending against good collateral, the central bank substitutes for deposits that run away.\n\nUpside: Stabilizes funding without guaranteeing all deposits.\n\nDownside: Risk of lending to insolvent banks (“bailouts”); stigma can deter use.\n\nExample: Bank of England in 19th century (“Bagehot’s rule” — lend freely, against good collateral, at a penalty rate).\n\n\n\n4. Deposit Insurance\n\nIdea: Government (or guarantee scheme) promises to repay depositors even if the bank fails.\n\nEligibility for such insurance is the definition of banking\n\nMechanism: Eliminates the late-type incentive to withdraw early → removes the bad equilibrium.\n\nUpside: Restores depositor confidence; cornerstone of modern banking systems.\n\nDownside: Creates moral hazard — banks and depositors may take more risk knowing deposits are guaranteed.\n\nExample: FDIC created in the U.S. in 1933 after widespread bank runs."

The ultimate objective is to convey a deep grasp of the past-present-future of the industry in order to prepare students for the ever changing landscape of banking and technology.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis course does not have mandatory prerequisites. It is however advised to have sufficient knowledge of basic economic modelling and completed the following courses first:\n\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nCorporate Finance."

Technological disruption\n\nFor many centuries, this record-keeping was provided by the government (i.e., central bank money) and the banks (i.e, deposit accounts).\nBlockchain: promise of distributed ledger technologies is that payments can be registered without the intervention of any central authority."

The discovery of administrative tablets from these complexes suggests that token use and consequently writing evolved as a tool of centralized economic governance.\nAn economy based on large-scale redistribution of goods cannot function on goodwill. It requires pre-commitment—promises of delivery that allow planning.\nWhen people started living in large communities like Uruk, they shared their lives with strangers as well as friends. It may have been possible to know everyone in a large farming village, but not in a vast city, such as Uruk.

Under ancient or medieval conditions, feeding such a force was an enormous problem—unless they were on the march, one would need to employ almost as many men and animals just to locate, acquire, and transport the necessary provisions.\nOn the other hand, if one simply hands out coins to the soldiers and then demands that every family in the kingdom was obliged to pay one of those coins back to you, one would, in one blow, turn one’s entire national economy into a vast machine for the provisioning of soldiers, since now every family, in order to get their hands on the coins, must find some way to contribute to the general effort to provide soldiers with things they want.\nMarkets are brought into existence as a side effect.”\n\nGraeber (2011)"

ACH – Automated Clearing House\nDefinition: Batch-processing system with net settlement (end-of-day or periodic)\nFeatures:\n\nPayments grouped into batches\n\nSettlement deferred\n\nCost-efficient, less liquidity needed compared to RTGS\n\nExamples: Nacha ACH (US), SEPA Credit Transfer/Direct Debit (EU)\nUse cases: low-value, high-volume payments (salaries, utility bills, e-commerce)\nDrawback: slower than RTGS; settlement not instantaneous\nACH Example: SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)\nSingle integrated EU market for euro payments with same rules and costs across participating countries. Launched 2008, fully implemented by 2014.\nScope(euro-denominated payments only): 36 countries: EU + EFTA (Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland) + Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, Vatican\nSEPA Instruments\n\nSEPA Credit Transfer (SCT): Standardized euro transfers, usually settled next day (D+1)\n\nSEPA Direct Debit (SDD): Framework for recurring payments (utilities, subscriptions)\n\nWorks across borders\n(Belgian account can authorize a French firm)\n\n\nSCT Instant (SCT Inst): &lt;10 seconds Real-time euro payments (up to €100,000, 24/7/365)\n\nIntroduced 2017\nUsed in P2P and e-commerce\n\n\n\n\nPolicy and Stability of Settlements\n\nCentral banks typically operate RTGS systems → backbone of financial stability\n\nACH networks: usually under central bank oversight, but often run by banking associations or private operators\n\nGrowing interest in faster payments:\n\nFaster Payments (UK)\n\nFedNow (US)\n\nPIX (Brazil)\n\nThese systems blur the line between ACH (retail, deferred) and RTGS (wholesale, immediate)\nKey point:\nRTGS and ACH are complementary\n\nRTGS = speed and finality, but costly\n\nACH = efficiency and scale, but slower"

By analogy, if too many borrowers wanted credit, interest rates should rise until demand = supply.\nStiglitz & Weiss (1981):\n\nShowed that in credit markets, raising interest rates changes who borrows, not just how much.\nHigher rates drive safe borrowers out, leaving a riskier pool (adverse selection).\nExpected bank profit is an inverted-U in the interest rate → banks may stop lending before the market clears.\nThis means credit rationing is an equilibrium outcome, not a temporary imperfection.\n\nImpact (together with Akerlof 1970):\n\nAkerlof’s Market for Lemons: price affects the quality of goods traded.\nStiglitz–Weiss: interest rates affect the quality of borrowers.\nTogether, these papers reshaped economics by showing how information asymmetries lead to persistent market failures.\n\n\n\nWhat the Model Explains in Practice\nFinancial exclusion: Some creditworthy borrowers are systematically denied loans (e.g., SMEs, low-income households).\nUnderinvestment in innovation: Innovative projects are harder to evaluate → more likely to be rationed.\nExplains why banks prefer lending against collateral (mortgages) rather than financing startups.\nPersistence of informal credit markets: When banks ration, borrowers turn to moneylenders or payday lenders, often at exorbitant rates.\nStructural inequality: Borrowers without collateral, reputation, or long relationships with banks are most likely to be excluded.\nWhy credit markets look different from goods markets: In goods markets, prices usually clear demand. In credit markets, queues, rejections, and “no” are common.\n\n\nInterventions\nScreening and information tools:\n\nCredit registries, credit bureaus, big data credit scoring.\nBetter borrower information reduces adverse selection.\n\nCollateral and covenants:\n\nLenders use assets and contractual restrictions to screen and align incentives.\n\nRelationship lending:\n\nLong-term interactions between bank and borrower reduce information asymmetry.\n\nPublic interventions:\n\nLoan guarantees (e.g., for SMEs).\nTargeted credit programs (student loans, housing finance).\n\n\n\nPolicy Implications\nJustification for regulation and intervention:\n\nMarket failures in credit justify government involvement.\nExplains the existence of development banks, credit guarantee schemes, and subsidized lending.\n\nFinancial stability link:\n\nRationing shows banks will not necessarily raise rates in response to stress → instead, they may cut lending (“credit crunch”).\nConnects to procyclicality of bank lending during crises.\n\nDistributional effects:\n\nCredit rationing disproportionately affects marginalized groups, creating inequality of opportunity.\nPolicies promoting financial inclusion (e.g., open banking, digital ID) have efficiency and equity benefits.\n\n\n\nModern Issues and Fintech\nFintech credit scoring:\n\nUse of alternative data (e.g., transaction histories, mobile phone data) reduces information gaps.\nCan mitigate adverse selection, expand credit access.\n\nPeer-to-peer and platform lending:\n\nPlatforms claim to overcome rationing by better matching of borrowers and investors.\nBut information asymmetry and selection issues persist (ratings, defaults).\n\nStablecoins and DeFi lending:\n\nCollateral-based lending dominates (e.g., overcollateralized crypto loans).\nIllustrates persistence of rationing: without information about borrower quality, only fully collateralized loans are feasible.\n\nPolicy debates today:\n\nOpen Banking and data portability as tools to reduce information frictions.\nBalancing financial inclusion with privacy."

    "text": "Discussion\n\nPaper Impact\n\nA foundational contribution to the modern theory of financial intermediation.\nProvided a microeconomic justification for why banks and markets coexist:\n\nBanks = delegated monitors under moral hazard.\nMarkets = arm’s-length financiers when incentives are self-enforcing.\n\n\nThe paper reframed finance as a problem of information governance, not just capital allocation.\nConceptual Breakthroughs\n\nIntroduced the notion of pledgeable income: &gt; Only the part of project returns consistent with incentives can be pledged to investors.\nExplained the hierarchy of finance:\n\nInternal finance (self-enforcing),\nIntermediated finance (requires monitoring),\nMarket finance (transparent, large-scale).\n\nLinked firm size, transparency, and financing mode:\n\nSmall, opaque → bank-dependent.\n\nLarge, visible → market-based.\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring as Information Production\n\nIn Holmström & Tirole (1997), banks monitor borrowers to prevent shirking.\n\nMonitoring does not only enforce effort — it also generates information and data about:\n\nborrower performance,\nbusiness viability,\nrepayment behavior.\n\n\nIn modern terms: monitoring = data production about creditworthiness and operations.\n\n\nThe Private Nature of Monitoring Data\n\nThe information a bank collects through monitoring is proprietary.\n\nIt represents private capital in the form of data:\n\ncostly to produce,\n\nand difficult for competitors to replicate.\n\nThis informational advantage can lock customers in:\n\nBorrowers may stay with their bank because the bank knows them best.\n\nCompeting lenders cannot easily assess risk without similar data.\n\n\n→ Private information → informational rents → market power.\n\n\nPolicy Implication: Open Data and Interoperability\n\nFrom a social efficiency perspective, data about borrower quality is non-rival: once produced, it could improve credit allocation if shared.\nHowever, private ownership of monitoring data leads to under-sharing and barriers to entry.\n\nThis motivates open data policies such as:\n\nOpen Banking / Open Finance:\nregulated data-sharing between financial institutions to enable competition and switching.\nStandardized APIs and interoperability frameworks:\nreduce information asymmetry while preserving privacy and security.\n\n\n\nEconomic Trade-Off\n\n Open Data Policies \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefit\nCost\n\n\n\n\nReduces switching costs and enhances competition\nWeakens private incentives to monitor and collect data\n\n\nImproves market contestability\nUnravelling: may reduce banks’ willingness to lend to no-data borrowers\n\n\n\nThe policy challenge:\nBalance the benefits of open access to data with the need to preserve monitoring incentives that sustain credit to informationally intensive sectors.\n\n\nModern Relevance\nAI and machine learning\nTechnologies to detect patterns of shirking or misuse of funds (reduce moral hazard).\nAs such they can reduce the cost of monitoring (\\(K\\)) thereby expanding further access to monitored credit\nData-driven economy\nMonitoring rents are becoming data rents.\n\nFintechs and BigTechs enter credit markets not through capital, but through informational advantage.\n\nOpen banking and data portability are policy tools designed to:\n\nlower barriers to entry,\n\nprevent informational monopolies,\n\nand reintroduce competition in the monitoring layer of finance.\n\n\nThe underlying principle remains Holmström–Tirole’s insight:\n\nInformation is costly to produce and privately valuable\nPublic policy must decide when to privatize it and when to share it."

    "text": "2. Central Banking and Supervision\nCentral banks stand at the core of modern financial governance.\nThey are not only responsible for monetary policy, but also for financial stability, crisis management, and — increasingly — regulatory supervision.\nTheir actions shape the overall stability, efficiency, and integrity of the financial system.\n\nCore Roles\nCentral banks fulfill several critical functions that go far beyond setting interest rates:\n\nGovernment’s Bank:\n\nManages public debt, issues government securities, and holds the state’s accounts and reserves.\n\nActs as fiscal agent for the Treasury.\n\nBanks’ Bank:\n\nProvides liquidity to commercial banks through lending facilities and lender-of-last-resort operations.\n\nEnsures the stability of the banking system during crises.\n\nMoney Supply and Monetary Policy:\n\nControls the quantity and price of base money (reserves and cash).\n\nUses policy tools to steer short-term interest rates and influence inflation and credit conditions.\n\nPayments and Infrastructure:\n\nOversees and operates payment and settlement systems to guarantee their safety and reliability.\n\nExample: TARGET2 in the Eurozone, Fedwire in the US.\n\nIntegrity and Stability:\n\nMonitors the soundness of the financial system and helps prevent its misuse for illicit activities.\n\nCoordinates with supervisors and FIUs on AML/CFT matters.\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of Central Bank Design\nA well-designed central bank must balance independence with accountability to maintain legitimacy and effectiveness.\n\nIndependence\n\nShields monetary policy from short-term political pressures.\n\nEssential for price stability and the credibility of commitments.\n\n\nIn the EU: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) guarantees the ECB’s institutional and operational independence — no government may seek to influence its decisions (Article 130).\n\n\n\nAccountability\n\nCentral banks must explain and justify decisions to parliaments, governments, and the public.\n\nStrengthens democratic oversight. &gt; In the EU: the ECB reports regularly to the European Parliament, including quarterly hearings and publication of its Annual Report submitted to both Parliament and the Council.\n\n\n\nTransparency\n\nRegular communication through minutes, forecasts, and forward guidance.\n\nReduces uncertainty and anchors market expectations.\n\n\nIn the EU: the ECB publishes detailed accounts of monetary policy meetings, press conferences after each Governing Council decision, and forward-looking projections to clarify its policy stance.\n\n\n\n\nMonetary Policy Framework\nMonetary policy provides the set of tools and operations through which central banks influence liquidity, interest rates, and credit conditions in the economy.\nIts design evolves with crises, financial innovation and macroeconomic conditions.\n\nConventional Monetary Policy\nConventional instruments operate through short-term interest rates and liquidity management.\nThey are used in normal times to steer inflation and stabilize the business cycle.\nMain tools:\n\nOpen Market Operations (OMOs)\n\nBuying or selling government securities to influence short-term interest rates and bank reserves.\n\nExample: the ECB’s Main Refinancing Operations (MROs) and Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs).\n\nStanding Facilities\n\nLending Facility - banks borrow overnight at a penalty rate.\n\nDeposit Facility - banks earn interest on excess reserves, setting a floor for market rates\n\nReserve Requirements\n\nMinimum reserves that banks must hold with the central bank; affect money market liquidity.\n\n\n\n\nNon-Conventional Monetary Policy\nWhen conventional tools reach their limits — notably at the zero lower bound on interest rates — central banks resort to non-conventional measures to maintain stability and support economic activity.\nKey instruments\n\nForward Guidance\n\nCommunication strategy that commits to setting interest rates for a defined period.\n\nShapes market expectations and reduces uncertainty.\n\nExample: ECB guidance post-2013 and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nQuantitative Easing (QE)\n\nLarge-scale purchases of government or private securities to inject liquidity and lower long-term interest rates.\n\nExample: ECB’s Asset Purchase Programme (APP) and Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).\n\nTargeted Lending (TLTROs)\n\nLong-term loans to banks at favorable rates, conditional on lending to the real economy.\n\nSupports credit flow to households and firms.\n\nNegative Interest Rates\n\nImposing a small cost on excess reserves held by banks to encourage lending.\n\nExample: ECB deposit rate below 0% between 2014–2022.\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Objectives\nAcross both conventional and non-conventional tools, the central goals remain:\n\nPrice Stability: maintaining inflation close to target (≈2% in the Eurozone).\n\nFinancial Stability: preventing credit bubbles and ensuring liquidity in stress periods.\n\nSustainable Growth: supporting economic recovery without compromising long-term stability.\n\n\n\n\nMonetary vs Fiscal Policy\nMonetary and fiscal authorities share overlapping goals but rely on different instruments and time horizons.\n\nFiscal Policy uses spending and taxation to influence demand and redistribute resources.\nMonetary Policy uses interest rates and liquidity to stabilize prices and the credit cycle.\n\nFundamental Tension arises when governments pressure central banks to keep rates low to reduce debt costs.\n- Leads to inflationary risks and undermines credibility.\n\n↓Central bank independence is crucial to prevent fiscal dominance and preserve long-term stability."

New Frontiers\nThe financial system is evolving rapidly under the influence of technology, data, and sustainability concerns.\nThese developments challenge traditional regulatory boundaries and call for new frameworks to ensure stability, fairness, and resilience.\nThe new frontiers of regulation address three major transitions: digitalization, cyber resilience, and climate sustainability.\n\nFintech & Digital Finance\nInnovation is reshaping how financial services are delivered and how risks emerge.\nRegulation aims to foster innovation without undermining financial stability or consumer protection.\nCrypto-assets and tokenization:\n- The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) provides a harmonized framework for crypto-asset issuance, trading, and service providers.\n- Covers stablecoins, utility tokens, and crypto-asset platforms.\nOpen Banking and Data Sharing:\n- PSD2 (Payment Services Directive 2) requires banks to open customer data (with consent) to licensed third parties via APIs.\n- Encourages competition and innovation in payments and financial services.\nNew Entrants:\n- Licensing of neobanks, payment institutions, and BigTechs entering finance.\n- Raises questions about level playing fields, data concentration, and cross-sector oversight.\n\n\nOperational Resilience and Cyber Risk\nAs finance becomes more digital and interconnected, technological failures and cyberattacks represent growing threats to financial stability.\nEU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA):\n- Establishes a unified framework for managing ICT and cyber risks across all financial entities.\n- Covers incident reporting, digital continuity, and oversight of third-party service providers (e.g., cloud computing).\n\n\nClimate and ESG Risks\nSustainability concerns are reshaping financial regulation as climate change introduces new forms of systemic risk and market disruption.\nEU Green Taxonomy:\n- Defines which economic activities qualify as environmentally sustainable to guide investment and disclosure.\nDisclosure and Reporting:\n- The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) mandate transparency on ESG risks and impacts.\nClimate Stress Testing:\n- Central banks and supervisors (e.g., ECB, BoE, NGFS) test banks’ exposure to physical and transition risks.\n- Encourages integration of climate considerations into risk management and capital planning."

    "section": "2. Policy Trade-offs",
    "text": "2. Policy Trade-offs\nFinancial regulation is about managing trade-offs between competing public objectives.\nNo single policy goal — stability, innovation, integrity, or inclusion — can be achieved in isolation.\nEffective governance requires regulators to balance risks and benefits across these dimensions, adapting rules as technology and markets evolve.\n\nStability vs Innovation\n\nStrong prudential and conduct rules protect the system from excessive risk-taking.\n\nYet, overly restrictive regulation may discourage experimentation and slow financial innovation.\n\nExample: strict capital rules can limit bank investment in fintech partnerships or new payment solutions.\n→ Challenge: support innovation while preserving financial stability.\n\n\n\nIntegrity vs Inclusion\n\nAML/CFT rules safeguard economic integrity and prevent illicit finance.\n\nBut strict compliance can lead to de-risking — banks withdrawing from high-risk regions or clients, reducing access to finance.\n\nParticularly affects small remittance providers and emerging economies.\n→ Challenge: fight financial crime without excluding legitimate users from the system.\n\n\n\nNational vs Supranational Oversight\n\nIn the EU, financial supervision is shared between national authorities and EU institutions (ECB, EBA, ESMA, AMLA).\n\nCoordination ensures consistency but can also slow decision-making and create accountability gaps.\n→ Challenge: align diverse national interests under a unified European framework.\n\n\n\nPrivacy vs Security\n\nData-sharing and surveillance are essential for detecting financial crime and systemic risks.\n\nYet they can conflict with data protection and individual privacy (e.g., GDPR constraints vs AML monitoring).\n→ Challenge: find the right balance between public safety and fundamental rights."
