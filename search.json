    "text": "Importance of Deposits\nDeposits are not just cheap funding — they are the core of money, payments, and stability in modern economies.\n\nFor Banks\n\nMain funding source:\n\nIn most banking systems, 50–70% of bank liabilities are deposits.\n\nExample: euro area banks in 2022 relied on ~55% deposits for total funding (ECB, 2023).\n\n\nLower cost of funds: Deposit rates typically below wholesale funding rates → key driver of net interest margin (BIS, 2022).\n\nStability: Retail deposits are more “sticky” than wholesale markets, providing resilience in crises (Gatev & Strahan, 2006).\n\nCrisis evidence: Banks with larger deposit bases were more stable in 2008 vs. wholesale-funded banks (Huang & Ratnovski, 2011).\n\n\n\nFor the Economy\n\nMoney supply backbone: Deposits are the dominant form of broad money.\n\nIn the euro area, about 85% of the total stock of money in the economy consists of bank deposits (ECB, Statistical Data Warehouse, 2023)\n\nPayment system: Deposits are the medium of most electronic payments and transfers.\n\nMonetary policy transmission: Deposit and lending rates are the key channels for central bank rate changes (Bernanke & Blinder, 1992).\n\nFinancial stability: Deposit runs have repeatedly triggered systemic crises (Calomiris & Gorton, 1991; Shin, 2009; Federal Reserve Board, 2023 on SVB)."

Suspension of Convertibility\n\nIdea: Temporarily freeze withdrawals, forcing all depositors to wait.\n\nMechanism: Breaks the run dynamic since \\(f\\) is fixed regardless of beliefs \\(\\hat f\\).\n\nUpside: Stops panic instantly.\n\nDownside: Very costly → disrupts payments, destroys trust, can trigger broader panic.\n\nHistorical use: 19th century U.S. banks and Argentina’s “corralito” in 2001.\n\n\n\n3. Lender of Last Resort (LOLR)\n\nIdea: Central bank provides emergency liquidity when banks face sudden outflows.\n\nMechanism: By lending against good collateral, the central bank substitutes for deposits that run away.\n\nUpside: Stabilizes funding without guaranteeing all deposits.\n\nDownside: Risk of lending to insolvent banks (“bailouts”); stigma can deter use.\n\nExample: Bank of England in 19th century (“Bagehot’s rule” — lend freely, against good collateral, at a penalty rate).\n\n\n\n4. Deposit Insurance\n\nIdea: Government (or guarantee scheme) promises to repay depositors even if the bank fails.\n\nEligibility for such insurance is the definition of banking\n\nMechanism: Eliminates the late-type incentive to withdraw early → removes the bad equilibrium.\n\nUpside: Restores depositor confidence; cornerstone of modern banking systems.\n\nDownside: Creates moral hazard — banks and depositors may take more risk knowing deposits are guaranteed.\n\nExample: FDIC created in the U.S. in 1933 after widespread bank runs."

No frictions\nIn a world without frictions, all trade takes place simultaneously on the centralised market.\nA transaction \\((q, y)\\) takes place if and only if it is mutually beneficial (i.e., it gives a positive net utility to both parties):\n\\[c(q)\\leq y \\leq u(q)\\]\n\n\n2. With frictions\nIn a world with frictions, buyers can renege on their commitment to provide \\(y\\) units of consumption to a seller in the centralised market.\n\nClose-knit community\nAssume that reneging would provoke the exclusion of the buyer.\nExclusion: loss of the continuation payoff \\(V^b\\) associated with future trades.\n\\(V^b\\) obtains from stationarity:\n\\[V^b = \\sigma U^b + \\frac{V^b}{1+r}\\]\nwhere \\(r\\) is the discount rate of the buyer.\nSolving in \\(V^b\\):\n\\[ V^b = \\frac{\\sigma U^b(1+r)}{r} = \\frac{\\sigma(1+r)}{r}[u(q)-y] \\]\nResult - Buyer honours an obligation to pay the seller whenever the payment \\(y\\) is lower than the discounted continuation pay-off \\(\\frac{V^b}{1+r}\\):\n\\[y \\leq \\frac{V^b}{1+r}\\]\n\n↓\n\n\\[y\\leq \\frac{\\sigma u (q)}{r+\\sigma}\\]\n\nComparing with no friction outcoume\n→ set of feasible transactions is strictly smaller\n\n\\[c(q)\\leq y \\leq \\frac{\\sigma u (q)}{r+\\sigma} \\leq u(q)\\]\nConclusion\nEven in a close-knit community, the impossibility to commit reduces the set of feasible transactions.\n\n\nComplete strangers\nIf the buyer and the seller are complete strangers because: the threat of exclusion has no bite.\nResult\nNo trade ever takes place because the seller knows that the buyer would never honour his payment obligation.\n\n\n\n3. Introducing money\nInefficiency can be overcome with money (Kocherlakota, 1998; Lagos and Wright, 2005).\nAdjustement to the set-up\nIntroduce tokens (coins or banknotes) that are accepted as means of payment by all agents. - The buyer can - Get \\(y\\) tokens by producing \\(y\\) units of the centralised good (normalise price to one token). - Later purchase \\(q\\) units of the decentralised good. - The seller agrees to deliver in exchange for the tokens if \\(V^t \\geq y\\): - The value \\(V^t\\) that the buyer derives from the tokens is larger than the cost of producing \\(y\\) units of the centralised good which is \\(y\\).\nThe continuation payoff \\(V^t\\) is given by: - Probability \\(σ\\) that the buyer matches with a seller tomorrow and buys \\(q\\) units of the decentralised good with the tokens; - Probability \\((1 − σ)\\) that the buyer keeps the tokens to use them in the future\n\\[V^t = \\frac{\\sigma u(q) + (1-\\sigma)V^t}{1+r} \\]\n\n↓\n\n\\[V^t = \\frac{\\sigma u (q)}{r + \\sigma} = V^b\\]\nResult\nTrade will take place with money if and only if:\n\\[c(q)\\leq y \\leq \\frac{\\sigma u (q)}{r+\\sigma} \\leq u(q)\\]\nwhich is exactly the same condition as in a close-knit community."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nMoney allows strangers to trade as if they were members of the same community. \n\n\nNote\n1. Shift in timing of trading\nThe timing of the trades between strangers is opposite to what happens in the close-knit community: - Close-knit community: trade relies on credit, which is repaid because of the threat of exclusion. - Among strangers: the buyer needs to work first to obtain the tokens.\nMoney then works as a record-keeping device: the tokens held by the buyer testify that the buyer has worked in the past.\n2. Technological disruption - For many centuries, this record-keeping was provided by the government (i.e., central bank money) and the banks (i.e, deposit accounts). - Blockchain: promise of distributed ledger technologies is that payments can be registered without the intervention of any central authority."

    "text": "Issuance of money and debt\nBirthplace of writing and accounting\n\n“In the classic model of the Sumerian economy, the temple functioned as an administrative authority governing commodity production, collection, and redistribution. The discovery of administrative tablets from these complexes suggests that token use and consequently writing evolved as a tool of centralized economic governance.\nAn economy based on large-scale redistribution of goods cannot function on goodwill. It requires pre-commitment—promises of delivery that allow planning.\nWhen people started living in large communities like Uruk, they shared their lives with strangers as well as friends. It may have been possible to know everyone in a large farming village, but not in a vast city, such as Uruk. What were once implicit agreements among neighbors now became explicit contractual agreements among strangers.\n\nGoetzmann, William N.. Money Changes Everything. Princeton University Press. “\n\n\nTributary economies - Egypt, Mesopotamia:\n- Goods and services flow mainly between rulers and subjects\n- Money’s role tied to political authority and record-keeping\nKey player: The State - State as the main issuer of money - Coins = tokens of state debt\n- Why trusted?\n- State can levy taxes in the same medium\n- Unique position: only the state ensures universal acceptance\n\nSay a king wishes to support a standing army of fifty thousand men. Under ancient or medieval conditions, feeding such a force was an enormous problem—unless they were on the march, one would need to employ almost as many men and animals just to locate, acquire, and transport the necessary provisions.\nOn the other hand, if one simply hands out coins to the soldiers and then demands that every family in the kingdom was obliged to pay one of those coins back to you, one would, in one blow, turn one’s entire national economy into a vast machine for the provisioning of soldiers, since now every family, in order to get their hands on the coins, must find some way to contribute to the general effort to provide soldiers with things they want.\nMarkets are brought into existence as a side effect.\n\nGraeber (2011)"

RTGS – Real-Time Gross Settlement\nDefinition: Payments settled individually, in real-time, with finality - “Gross” = each transaction processed separately\nFeatures:\n- Immediate settlement between banks\n- Irrevocable and final once processed\n- Eliminates settlement risk\nExamples: Fedwire (US), TARGET2 (Eurozone), BOJ-NET (Japan), CHAPS (UK)\nUse cases: large-value, time-critical payments (interbank transfers, securities settlement)\nDrawback: liquidity-intensive (banks must hold sufficient balances at central bank)\nRTGS Example: TARGET2 - Pan-European RTGS system operated by the Eurosystem\n- Settles payments in central bank money\n- Handles large-value and urgent transactions across the Eurozone\n- Backbone of European financial stability infrastructure\n\n\n2. ACH – Automated Clearing House\nDefinition: Batch-processing system with net settlement (end-of-day or periodic)\nFeatures:\n- Payments grouped into batches\n- Settlement deferred\n- Cost-efficient, less liquidity needed compared to RTGS\nExamples: Nacha ACH (US), SEPA Credit Transfer/Direct Debit (EU)\nUse cases: low-value, high-volume payments (salaries, utility bills, e-commerce)\nDrawback: slower than RTGS; settlement not instantaneous\nACH Example: SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)\nSingle integrated EU market for euro payments with same rules and costs across participating countries. Launched 2008, fully implemented by 2014.\nScope(euro-denominated payments only): 36 countries: EU + EFTA (Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland) + Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, Vatican\nSEPA Instruments - SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT): Standardized euro transfers, usually settled next day (D+1)\n- SEPA Direct Debit (SDD): Framework for recurring payments (utilities, subscriptions)\n- Works across borders\n(Belgian account can authorize a French firm)\n- SCT Instant (SCT Inst): &lt;10 seconds Real-time euro payments (up to €100,000, 24/7/365)\n- Introduced 2017 - Used in P2P and e-commerce\n\n\nPolicy and Stability of Settlements\n\nCentral banks typically operate RTGS systems → backbone of financial stability\n\nACH networks: usually under central bank oversight, but often run by banking associations or private operators\n\nGrowing interest in faster payments: - Faster Payments (UK)\n- FedNow (US)\n- PIX (Brazil)\nThese systems blur the line between ACH (retail, deferred) and RTGS (wholesale, immediate)\nKey point:\nRTGS and ACH are complementary\n- RTGS = speed and finality, but costly\n- ACH = efficiency and scale, but slower"

- What matters is the division of fees (who pays what), not just the total. - The monopoly platform must balance margins across both sides: \\(\\frac{a_b}{\\eta_b^{a}} = \\frac{a_s}{\\eta_s^{a}}\\) - Each side’s demand elasticity already reflects network externalities.\n- No single Lerner condition holds — instead, a balancing condition across sides emerges.\n- This explains why cardholders may receive subsidies (negative price, rewards) while merchants pay fees: the platform redistributes to maximize joint adoption.\nTension: Social vs Private Optimum\n\nPrivate platform objective: maximize profit = transaction volume × (fees – costs).\nSocial planner objective: maximize total welfare (consumer surplus + merchant surplus – costs).\nDistortion arises because platforms may overcharge one side or underprovide adoption.\n\nPolicy Implications\n\nRegulators care because fee structure affects adoption and social welfare.\nKey issues:\n\nInterchange fee caps (EU, Australia).\nPromoting access for smaller merchants.\nEncouraging innovation while avoiding excessive merchant fees."
