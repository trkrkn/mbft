Early Banking Practices\n\nMesopotamia (2000 BCE)\n\nHammurabi’s Code (Babylon) → regulated loans & debt &gt; Law 100: “If a merchant gives silver as a loan at interest, he shall take only 1 shekel of silver as interest on 1 shekel; if he takes more, he shall forfeit all.”\n\nLaw 117: “If a man be in debt and he sell his wife, son, or daughter, they shall serve for three years in the house of the purchaser or creditor; in the fourth year they shall regain their freedom.”\n\n\nAncient Greece: trapeza (money changers)\n\n\n\n2. Medieval & Renaissance (10th-15th c.)\n\nTemplars (12th–14th c.):\n\nCheque-like instruments for crusaders & pilgrims\n\nFirst international financial system\n\n\nItalian city-states (12th–15th c.): Florence, Venice, Genoa = trade hubs\n\nMedici Bank (1397–1494): first multinational bank\n\nPacioli’s innovation (1494): double-entry bookkeeping\n\n\n\n\n3. Colonial Expansion (15th–17th c.)\nFinance to support growth of trade - Banco di San Giorgio (1407) – Genoa - First public bank - Managed public debt, accepted deposits\n- Bank of Amsterdam (1609)\n- Standardized coinage, clearing bank, proto-central bank\n- Venetian banks: financed global trade & wars\n\n\n4. Industrial Revolution (19th c.)\n\nSavings & cooperative banks\n\nCheque system spread\n\n\n\n5. Rise of Modern Banking (20th - today c.)\n\nPost-WWII → retail banking boom\n\nChecking accounts, mortgages, consumer credit\n\n\nRegulation after crises (e.g., 1929)\n\nGlobalisation → multinational banking groups\nTechnological Innovation\n\n1950s: Payment cards (Diners Club, later Visa/MasterCard)\n\n1967: ATMs (Barclays, UK)\n\n1973: SWIFT messaging system"

No frictions\nIn a world without frictions, all trade takes place simultaneously on the centralised market.\nA transaction \\((q, y)\\) takes place if and only if it is mutually beneficial (i.e., it gives a positive net utility to both parties):\n\\[c(q)\\leq y \\leq u(q)\\]\n\n\n2. With frictions\nIn a world with frictions, buyers can renege on their commitment to provide \\(y\\) units of consumption to a seller in the centralised market.\n\nClose-knit community\nAssume that reneging would provoke the exclusion of the buyer.\nExclusion: loss of the continuation payoff \\(V^b\\) associated with future trades.\n\\(V^b\\) obtains from stationarity:\n\\[V^b = \\sigma U^b + \\frac{V^b}{1+r}\\]\nwhere \\(r\\) is the discount rate of the buyer.\nSolving in \\(V^b\\):\n\\[ V^b = \\frac{\\sigma U^b(1+r)}{r} = \\frac{\\sigma(1+r)}{r}[u(q)-y] \\]\nResult - Buyer honours an obligation to pay the seller whenever the payment \\(y\\) is lower than the discounted continuation pay-off \\(\\frac{V^b}{1+r}\\):\n\\[y \\leq \\frac{V^b}{1+r}\\]\n\n↓\n\n\\[y\\leq \\frac{\\sigma u (q)}{r+\\sigma}\\]\n\nComparing with no friction outcoume\n→ set of feasible transactions is strictly smaller\n\n\\[c(q)\\leq y \\leq \\frac{\\sigma u (q)}{r+\\sigma} \\leq u(q)\\]\nConclusion\nEven in a close-knit community, the impossibility to commit reduces the set of feasible transactions.\n\n\nComplete strangers\nIf the buyer and the seller are complete strangers because: the threat of exclusion has no bite.\nResult\nNo trade ever takes place because the seller knows that the buyer would never honour his payment obligation.\n\n\n\n3. Introducing money\nInefficiency can be overcome with money (Kocherlakota, 1998; Lagos and Wright, 2005).\nAdjustement to the set-up\nIntroduce tokens (coins or banknotes) that are accepted as means of payment by all agents. - The buyer can - Get \\(y\\) tokens by producing \\(y\\) units of the centralised good (normalise price to one token). - Later purchase \\(q\\) units of the decentralised good. - The seller agrees to deliver in exchange for the tokens if \\(V^t \\geq y\\): - The value \\(V^t\\) that the buyer derives from the tokens is larger than the cost of producing \\(y\\) units of the centralised good which is \\(y\\).\nThe continuation payoff \\(V^t\\) is given by: - Probability \\(σ\\) that the buyer matches with a seller tomorrow and buys \\(q\\) units of the decentralised good with the tokens; - Probability \\((1 − σ)\\) that the buyer keeps the tokens to use them in the future\n\\[V^t = \\frac{\\sigma u(q) + (1-\\sigma)V^t}{1+r} \\]\n\n↓\n\n\\[V^t = \\frac{\\sigma u (q)}{r + \\sigma} = V^b\\]\nResult\nTrade will take place with money if and only if:\n\\[c(q)\\leq y \\leq \\frac{\\sigma u (q)}{r+\\sigma} \\leq u(q)\\]\nwhich is exactly the same condition as in a close-knit community."

Shift in timing of trading\nThe timing of the trades between strangers is opposite to what happens in the close-knit community: - Close-knit community: trade relies on credit, which is repaid because of the threat of exclusion. - Among strangers: the buyer needs to work first to obtain the tokens.\nMoney then works as a record-keeping device: the tokens held by the buyer testify that the buyer has worked in the past.\n2. Technological disruption - For many centuries, this record-keeping was provided by the government (i.e., central bank money) and the banks (i.e, deposit accounts). - Blockchain: promise of distributed ledger technologies is that payments can be registered without the intervention of any central authority."

    "text": "Issuance of money and debt\nBirthplace of writing and accounting\n\n“In the classic model of the Sumerian economy, the temple functioned as an administrative authority governing commodity production, collection, and redistribution. The discovery of administrative tablets from these complexes suggests that token use and consequently writing evolved as a tool of centralized economic governance.\nAn economy based on large-scale redistribution of goods cannot function on goodwill. It requires pre-commitment—promises of delivery that allow planning.\nWhen people started living in large communities like Uruk, they shared their lives with strangers as well as friends. It may have been possible to know everyone in a large farming village, but not in a vast city, such as Uruk. What were once implicit agreements among neighbors now became explicit contractual agreements among strangers.\n\nGoetzmann, William N.. Money Changes Everything. Princeton University Press. “\n\n\nTributary economies - Egypt, Mesopotamia:\n- Goods and services flow mainly between rulers and subjects\n- Money’s role tied to political authority and record-keeping\nKey player: The State - State as the main issuer of money - Coins = tokens of state debt\n- Why trusted?\n- State can levy taxes in the same medium\n- Unique position: only the state ensures universal acceptance\n\nSay a king wishes to support a standing army of fifty thousand men. Under ancient or medieval conditions, feeding such a force was an enormous problem—unless they were on the march, one would need to employ almost as many men and animals just to locate, acquire, and transport the necessary provisions.\nOn the other hand, if one simply hands out coins to the soldiers and then demands that every family in the kingdom was obliged to pay one of those coins back to you, one would, in one blow, turn one’s entire national economy into a vast machine for the provisioning of soldiers, since now every family, in order to get their hands on the coins, must find some way to contribute to the general effort to provide soldiers with things they want.\nMarkets are brought into existence as a side effect.\n\nGraeber (2011)"

    "text": "Course Description\nThis course is a compulsory course for the International and Sustainable Finance Track in the Master of Business Administration curriculum at the Faculty of Economics and Business, Brussels Campus, KU Leuven.\nThe course objectives are:\n\nTo train students to produce scientifically based solutions to modern banking issues\nTo introduce trends in financial technologies\nTo provide students with a wide range of technological and policy challenges and opportunities in banking and finance\nTo induce both macro and micro assessments of the impact of new technologies for banking and the economy\n\nThe course features a balance between traditional banking issues (intermediation, money, payments, instruments, deposits, financial contracts, financial stability, liquidity, monetary policy, interest rates, bank runs, regulation, bail outs) and modern banking issues (digitalisation, platforms, crypto, AI, DeFi, smart contracts, shadow banking, macroprudential policy, Big Tech, open finance, CBDC). The ultimate objective is to convey a deep grasp of the past-present-future of the industry in order to prepare students for the ever changing landscape of banking and technology.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis course does not have mandatory prerequisites. It is however advised to have sufficient knowledge of basic economic modelling and completed the following courses first:\n\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nCorporate Finance."

RTGS – Real-Time Gross Settlement\nDefinition: Payments settled individually, in real-time, with finality - “Gross” = each transaction processed separately\nFeatures:\n- Immediate settlement between banks\n- Irrevocable and final once processed\n- Eliminates settlement risk\nExamples: Fedwire (US), TARGET2 (Eurozone), BOJ-NET (Japan), CHAPS (UK)\nUse cases: large-value, time-critical payments (interbank transfers, securities settlement)\nDrawback: liquidity-intensive (banks must hold sufficient balances at central bank)\nRTGS Example: TARGET2 - Pan-European RTGS system operated by the Eurosystem\n- Settles payments in central bank money\n- Handles large-value and urgent transactions across the Eurozone\n- Backbone of European financial stability infrastructure\n\n\n2. ACH – Automated Clearing House\nDefinition: Batch-processing system with net settlement (end-of-day or periodic)\nFeatures:\n- Payments grouped into batches\n- Settlement deferred\n- Cost-efficient, less liquidity needed compared to RTGS\nExamples: Nacha ACH (US), SEPA Credit Transfer/Direct Debit (EU)\nUse cases: low-value, high-volume payments (salaries, utility bills, e-commerce)\nDrawback: slower than RTGS; settlement not instantaneous\nACH Example: SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)\nSingle integrated EU market for euro payments with same rules and costs across participating countries. Launched 2008, fully implemented by 2014.\nScope(euro-denominated payments only): 36 countries: EU + EFTA (Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland) + Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, Vatican\nSEPA Instruments - SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT): Standardized euro transfers, usually settled next day (D+1)\n- SEPA Direct Debit (SDD): Framework for recurring payments (utilities, subscriptions)\n- Works across borders\n(Belgian account can authorize a French firm)\n- SCT Instant (SCT Inst): &lt;10 seconds Real-time euro payments (up to €100,000, 24/7/365)\n- Introduced 2017 - Used in P2P and e-commerce\n\n\nPolicy and Stability of Settlements\n\nCentral banks typically operate RTGS systems → backbone of financial stability\n\nACH networks: usually under central bank oversight, but often run by banking associations or private operators\n\nGrowing interest in faster payments: - Faster Payments (UK)\n- FedNow (US)\n- PIX (Brazil)\nThese systems blur the line between ACH (retail, deferred) and RTGS (wholesale, immediate)\nKey point:\nRTGS and ACH are complementary\n- RTGS = speed and finality, but costly\n- ACH = efficiency and scale, but slower"

    "text": "Rochet & Tirole’s Framework\nRochet and Tirole (2003) introduced a fundemantal paper on payments which influenced the rest of the economy.\nModel - Fees: \\(f_b\\) (buyers) and \\(f_s\\) (sellers). - Side-specific marginal costs: \\(c_b\\), \\(c_s\\). - Markups: - \\(p_b \\equiv f_b - c_b\\) - \\(p_s \\equiv f_s - c_s\\) - Adoption: - \\(n_b = n_b(f_b)\\) with \\(n_b’&lt;0\\) - \\(n_s = n_s(f_s)\\) with \\(n_s’&lt;0\\). - Transactions (simple network tech): \\(T(n_b,n_s) = n_b\\,n_s\\).\nPayment platform’s profit \\[\\Pi(f_b,f_s)=\\big[(f_b-c_b)+(f_s-c_s)\\big]\\;n_b(f_b)\\,n_s(f_s)\n= (p_b+p_s)\\,n_b(f_b)\\,n_s(f_s)\\]\n\nEquilibrium price\nDifferentiate profit w.r.t. fees (keeping costs inside via \\(p_i=f_i-c_i\\)):\n\\[\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial f_b}\n= n_b n_s + (p_b+p_s)\\,n_s\\,n_b’(f_b)\n= n_b n_s\\!\\left(1 + (p_b+p_s)\\frac{n_b’(f_b)}{n_b}\\right)=0\\]\n\\[\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial f_s}\n= n_b n_s + (p_b+p_s)\\,n_b\\,n_s’(f_s)\n= n_b n_s\\!\\left(1 + (p_b+p_s)\\frac{n_s’(f_s)}{n_s}\\right)=0.\n\\]\nDivide by \\(n_b n_s&gt;0\\): \\[1 + M\\frac{n_b’(f_b)}{n_b}=0,\\qquad\n1 + M\\frac{n_s’(f_s)}{n_s}=0,\\] where \\(M\\equiv p_b+p_s\\) is total per-transaction markup.\nAdoption elasticities\n\\[\\varepsilon_b^{\\,p}\\;\\equiv\\;-\\frac{p_b}{n_b}\\,n_b’(f_b)&gt;0\\] \\[\\varepsilon_s^{\\,p}\\;\\equiv\\;-\\frac{p_s}{n_s}\\,n_s’(f_s)&gt;0\\]\nThen \\(\\frac{n_b’(f_b)}{n_b}=-\\frac{\\varepsilon_b^{\\,p}}{p_b}\\) and similarly for \\(s\\).\nPlugging into the FOCs: \\[1 - M\\frac{\\varepsilon_b^{\\,p}}{p_b}=0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; M=\\frac{p_b}{\\varepsilon_b^{\\,p}}\\]\n\\[1 - M\\frac{\\varepsilon_s^{\\,p}}{p_s}=0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; M=\\frac{p_s}{\\varepsilon_s^{\\,p}}\\]\n\n\nThe Balancing Principle\nBalancing condition\n\\[\\boxed{\\;\\frac{p_b}{\\varepsilon_b^{\\,p}} \\;=\\; \\frac{p_s}{\\varepsilon_s^{\\,p}} \\;=\\; M\\;}\n\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad\n\\boxed{\\;\\frac{f_b - c_b}{\\varepsilon_b^{\\,p}} \\;=\\; \\frac{f_s - c_s}{\\varepsilon_s^{\\,p}}\\;}\\]\nIntuition: - Raising \\(f_b\\) changes profit via markup \\(p_b\\) and hurts quantity via adoption elasticity $_b^{,p} $(which already includes network feedback). - Optimal pricing balances those marginal trade-offs across sides. - The more price-sensitive side gets a lower (even negative) price; the less elastic side bears more → matches consumer rewards + merchant fees.\n\n\nComparison with Lerner Formula\nImportance: The Lerner rule is a benchmark in industrial organization — it links market power directly to demand elasticity.\nTraditional Lerner condition:\n\\[\\frac{p - c}{p} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\]\n→ price–cost margin equals the inverse demand elasticity.\nDifference - In two-sided markets, the platform must balance margins across both sides:\n- Each side’s demand elasticity already reflects network externalities.\n- No single Lerner condition holds — instead, a balancing condition across sides emerges.\n- This explains why cardholders may receive subsidies (negative price, rewards) while merchants pay fees: the platform redistributes to maximize joint adoption.\n\n\nDiscussion\nPrice structure: In two-sided markets, what matters is the division of fees (who pays what), not just the total.\nRochet & Tirole’s key insight: - Optimal pricing structure balances participation on both sides. - Platform may subsidize one side to attract the other.\nExample: - Credit card markets often subsidize cardholders (low or negative \\(f_C\\), via rewards). - Merchants bear higher fees (\\(f_M\\)), since they gain from increased sales.\nSocial vs Private Optimum\n\nPrivate platform objective: maximize profit = transaction volume × (fees – costs).\nSocial planner objective: maximize total welfare (consumer surplus + merchant surplus – costs).\nDistortion arises because platforms may overcharge one side or underprovide adoption.\nRaises policy questions about interchange fee regulation.\n\nPolicy Implications\n\nRegulators care because fee structure affects adoption and social welfare.\nKey issues:\n\nInterchange fee caps (EU, Australia).\nPromoting access for smaller merchants.\nEncouraging innovation while avoiding excessive merchant fees."
