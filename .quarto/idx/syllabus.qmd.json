The ultimate objective is to convey a deep grasp of the past-present-future of the industry in order to prepare students for the ever changing landscape of banking and technology.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThis course does not have mandatory prerequisites. It is however advised to have sufficient knowledge of basic economic modelling and completed the following courses first:\n\n- Financial Markets and Institutions\n- Corporate Finance.\n\n## Organization\n\nThis course consists of 6 ECTS amounting to 40 contact hours. Sessions are split between core material, live discussions, and guest lectures. All sessions are integral to the course.\n\n\n### Material\n\nThe class addresses the one key dimension of banking and financial technology: information frictions. As such, the material starts with the role played by information in every aspect of modern banking. Three key topics in the development of fintech are then studied: platforms, machine learning and crypto. \n\n### Overview\n\nMap of topics\n\n| Side | Topics |\n| --- | --- |\n| Modern Banking | Money <br> Payment <br> Deposit <br> Systemic Risk <br> Policy & Regulation |\n|Platforms| Digital Platforms <br> Fintech Platforms <br> Bigtech <br> Open Banking|\n|Machine Learning| History <br> Economics of ML <br> Technology of ML <br> Application of ML in Finance|\n|Crypto|Distributed Ledger Technolonies <br> Smart Contracts <br> Stablecoins <br> Decentralised Finance <br> Central Bank Digital Currencies|\n# Assessment\n\nThis class values interactions and discussions. As such, students are expected to be active and engaging in live sessions. The examination is an individual written examination where the student demonstrates mastery of the class material as well as capacity to engage in transversal questions covering multiple parts of the course.
